TWS: My website will say what Chinese citizens are missing and it will show how many websites are blocked

i)China has a blocking system called censorship which blocks a lot of websites. This takes Chinese citizens their freedom because they are blocking social media and thousand more websites that people use every day.

ii)Some primary sources that could show how censorship is like in china are like illegal blogs or websites. Some secondary sources that could show evidence are:
www.scmp.com/topics/censorship-china
https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/media-censorship-china
This will be a good research method because there is a lot of websites that could tell you thing that you probably didn't know.

iii)There are many ways to bypass the China censorship like DNS servers and VPN are some solutions to bypass China censorship. If people bypass the China censorship the government because it is a way of protesting for internet freedom

iv)All of this shows what Chinese citizens are missing what China is taking from them. My website shows why China censorship is bad because it takes freedom. If you research more about the China censorship you'll see how the censorship affects China.
